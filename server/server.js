I have never even come close to losing grip even in the hot sun while all sweaty. I like how the weight ends up at the head rather than the middle. This gives me the most force where I need it. I have pretty much stopped using all my hammers. (Who doesn\'t have like 10).Whereas before I might have just gone in my box to grab another to keep working if i temporarily misplaced mine, now I will stop what I am doing and find this one. ',
